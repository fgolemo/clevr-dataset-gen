Renders random scenes using Blender, each with with a random number of objects;
each object has a random size, position, color, and shape. Objects will be
nonintersecting but may partially occlude each other. Output images will be
written to disk as PNGs, and we will also write a JSON file for each image with
ground-truth scene information.
